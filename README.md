# Sheeter

## What is Seeter?
Sheeter is a a website for creating, storing and organiazing RPG character
sheets for all sorts of systems.

It is curently no more than an off-time project planned only for personal use.

This is my first web-development project, so expect to see a lot of 
"non-standart code", but it is being developed with scalability and good 
practices in mind, serving as a study project.

## How is it being developed?
This project is heavily inspired by the book "Let's Go: Learn to Build 
Professional Web Applications with Go" by Alex Edwards, and uses the same 
technologies as the tutorial-project of that book:

Back-end made using mainly standart Golang libraries, some open-source 
middleware and MySQL (actually MariaDB, but interchangable) for a database.

Front-end made with standart Golang HTML templates and raw CSS/JS files.

## What's planed?
As stated above, this is a project made with study and persoal use in mind.

I plan to release a complete (albeit kind of "bare-bones") "1.0" version of it
until February/2023, with all basic functionalities, a complete interface and an
easy way to add more types of sheets, along with all the proper documentation.

I do plan to push the project further after that, but with no clear goal in 
mind, so there's no garantee of what may come out of it.

## Who's working on it?
Sheeter is currently being developed only by me, with the help of some friends
(mainly for lack-of-artistic-talent reasons) who are credited and have their 
info credited below:

## I like the idea! Can i make a Sheeters for myself?
Sure! Feel free to fork and clone this repository at will.

If i ever decide to make this project private for any reason, i will still keep
a public, free-to-fork repo with a complete working version of the project.

I am making a tool hat will be useful for me and i hope many more tabletop RPG
enthusiasts may benefit from it as well.

## I have a cool idea for a feature
## I want to report a problem
## I want to contact you for whatever other reason
Fell free to contact me for any feedback on this project through my email:

Happy dice-rolling!
